## Reflection
The goal of the project was to realize and deeply understand HTML, SASS, BEM method and 7/1 folders design.

Originally I wanted to build an application that an Advertise a company that sells nature tours in different categories , such as forest. I started this process by using the HTML and SASS.

One of the main challenges I ran into was desgin this website. This lead me to spend a time on a research of how to design modern website with a lot of new tricks and modern design in SASS.

At the end of the day, the technologies implemented in this project are HTML, SASS.
